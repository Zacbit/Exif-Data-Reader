# Exif Data Reader

This is a little app I made in JS to pull all the exif data out of an Image. 
Most apps delete the exif data from Images (because it includes sensitive informations such as when and where you took the photo, etc) but this app is for the images that still haven't had there data purged. I am using exif-js to pull the data out. My initial idea was to also pull images from links but NO-CORS wont let that happen, unfortunatly.
